# Linear-SVM-Implementation-Baseed-on-Kaggle-Competition
This repository contains the implementation of a linear Support Vector Machine (SVM) for a binary classification task in the DDA4210 Advanced machine learning mini project. The goal of the project is to train a machine learning model to separate two classes based on the given features.
